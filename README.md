# AI-driven-crop-disease-prediction-and-management-system
The project involved training CNN-based image classification models using TensorFlow and Keras. Image preprocessing and data augmentation techniques were applied to improve model accuracy. The trained system classifies healthy and diseased crops effectively, enabling early disease detection and improved agricultural decisionmaking.
